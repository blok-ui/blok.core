v0.9.0 Breaking Changes
=======================

- All instances of `RealNode` have been changed to `Primitive`. This includes:
  
  - VRealNode -> VPrimitive
  - RealNodeComponent -> Primitive
  - Component.getRealNode() -> Component.getPrimitive()
  
  These changes can mostly be handled by doing a find/replace on your project and change all cases of "RealNode" to "Primitive".

- `Component` has been dropped from `RootComponent` -- it's just "Root" now.

- `ComponentBase` is now called `View`.

- The confusing `blok.node` package has been removed and the classes that were found in it are now in `blok.html.server`. These were only used to mock up the DOM in non-browser contexts and they should make more sense there. 

Because Block is pre-release, no depreciations have been made for these -- your code will just break until you change the names. Sorry about that.
