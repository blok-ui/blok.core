Blok UI
=======

Just to acknowledge it: at the moment, most of the code in this folder was either heavily inspired by or (in some cases) ported directly from [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). The naming conventions of `Widget` and `Element` are perhaps a bit of a giveaway -- they both come from there.  

Blok *does* start to diverge pretty quickly from Flutter once you get above this layer (and even in a lot of the implementation details), so don't rely on it too much to understand what's going on with Blok.
