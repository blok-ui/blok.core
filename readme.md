Blok Core
=========

Blok's core functionality.

> Note: this package is not meant to be used alone. It provides basic functionality and interfaces that Blok Platforms implement.
>
> Generally, all classes in the root `blok` package require a platform implementation to work, while `blok.core` contains the tools to do the implementing. This structure may change as the project matures.
